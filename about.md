In January of 2017, I left my old career behind and began my apprenticeship in [Bloc's](https://bloc.io) full-stack web developer program. Interactive technology has always captured my imagination -- from my cousin's C64 to running my first BBS to building system requirements which thousands of associates would use, and so much more.

I built my first website during my internship at Bank One back in 1999. Armed with Notepad, a thick _"LEARN HTML!!!"_ book and some company collateral, a portion of my summer was spent manipulating code in a text file and watching its design on screen. It used a navigation bar in frames, spacer gifs, some drop down menus and was used for quite some time even after its completion.

I intermittently dabbled in building sites after that (in college as a hobby, another intranet site for an international company, some business sites for family entrepreneurs, and a couple non-profits) but juggling my desire to do well in my then-career with all of my other hobbies, one of them had to go. Web technology was undergoing a massive evolution, and I couldn't afford to keep up with the times. The shift into web development has been a deliberate one, and one I hope to grow with and add to as technology and the way we interact with it evolves.

My goal is to focus on the parts of my career which fueled my passions: creativity, problem-solving, story-telling, and the sharing of information to promote emotive experiences.
