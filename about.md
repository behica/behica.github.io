This site started on a simple as possible base Jekyll theme.

In January of 2017, I began my apprenticeship in Bloc's full-stack web developer program. In a former life, I worked as a sales operations specialist focusing on data visualization, analytics, CRM building and process optimization.

Stay tuned for more information about who I am, and what I'm doing here.

Do note that this site is a work in progress. It is my digital sandbox; a playground for thoughts, design, projects, and general knowledge application as I discover it. As the saying goes -- Pardon my dust.
