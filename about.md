In January of 2017, I left my old career behind and began my apprenticeship in [Bloc's](https://bloc.io) full-stack web developer program. Interactive technology has always captured my imagination -- from my cousin's C64 to running my first BBS to building system requirements which thousands of associates would use, and so much more.

I built my first website during my internship at Bank One back in 1999. Armed with Notepad, a thick _"LEARN HTML!!!"_ book and some company collateral, a portion of my summer was spent manipulating code in a text file and watching its design on screen. It used a navigation bar in frames, spacer gifs, some drop down menus, and was their live intranet site for quite some time after its completion.

I intermittently dabbled in building sites after that (in college as a hobby, another intranet site for an international company I worked for, some business sites for family entrepreneurs, and a couple non-profits) but juggling my desire to do well in my then-career with all of my other hobbies, one of them had to go. Web technology was undergoing a massive evolution, and I couldn't afford to keep up with the times. My shift back into coding and creating has been a deliberate one, and one I hope to grow with and add to as technology and the way we interact with it evolves. I have recently completed Bloc's web development curriculum and look forward to forging my new career.

My goal is to focus on the parts of my life which fueled my passions: creativity, problem-solving, story-telling, and the sharing of information to promote emotive experiences.
