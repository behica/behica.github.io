title:  First Meetup - Naperville WordPress Group
---

Tonight's experience consists of heading out to my first meetup.com gathering (or meetup). The group has been together since January of 2013, gathering enthusiasts and professionals alike to talk about what they've built, share WordPress tips, and learn from one another. Their experience ranges from web design and development, to SEO, graphic design, email marketing and includes industries from NGOs, security, photography and more.

Topics covered appeal to both the beginner and advanced user, changing month to month to ensure the broader base is covered and provied options as their experience grows, and new members settle in. My startingn experience with the group puts me in a series of workshops where they guide members on how to build a WordPress site from scratch. I come in at step 3, 'Front-End Theme Building.'

WP themes are PHP - control design, and functionality, of the website. 
WordPress Developer - job path? Options? How closely related to full-stack dev?

Themes should control design, not full functionality. CSS vs. JS vs. HTML types vs. Frameworks-->
