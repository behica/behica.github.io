    <p>I am a former sales ops leader who has morphed into a web developer. Over the years, I've mentored people, built processes, transitioned CRMs, provided trainings, modeled data, and made sure we were doing it the best way possible. I wanted to get in the world of creating the code behind experiences with technology. Welcome to my journey.</p>
