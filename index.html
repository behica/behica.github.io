    <p>I am a sales ops leader who writes, takes photos, and tinkers in web development. Over the years, I've mentored people, built processes, transitioned CRMs, provided trainings, modeled data, and made sure it was done it the best way possible. I want to share my creative experiences with the world. Welcome to my journey.</p>
